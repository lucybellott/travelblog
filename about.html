        <p id="about-text">Iâ€™m a software engineer born in Rio, Brazil, 
            now living in the vibrant city of New York. 
            <br/>My passion for traveling, art, and diverse cultures knows no bounds. 
            I am constantly fueled by the desire to immerse myself in new experiences and make connections with people from all walks of life, 
            I find myself always excited to explore unknown territories. 
            <br/>I created this blog as a digital diary to chronicle the moments of my journeys. 
            From visiting family and friends scattered across the globe to venturing into undiscovered corners of the world, 
            each adventure is a canvas waiting to be painted with vibrant memories and enriching encounters. 
            <br/>Through my blog, 
            I aim to share the beauty of world exploration and the essence of the places I'm fortunate to encounter along the way.</p>
